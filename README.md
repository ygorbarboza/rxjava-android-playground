## RxJava Android Playground

### Purpose

This project it's just a study one, for playing with RxJava, RxAndroid, RxBindings, RxLifecycle and other Rx related libraries on Android, just for learning purposes

### What I can find here?
Right now? Nothing :( but my plan is to demonstrate:

* Usage of RxJava in regular Android development workflow
* Usage of Android specific Rx libraries, such as RxAndroid, RxLifecycle, RxBindings and others
* Testing techniques when using RxJava
* Party tricks to impress your friends! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ (kidding)


### List of exercises
I'll update this section as soon as I have new stuff coming!
