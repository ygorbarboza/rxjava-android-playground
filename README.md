## RxJava Android Playground

### Purpose

This project is just a study one, for playing with RxJava, RxAndroid, RxBindings, RxLifecycle and other Rx related libraries on Android, just for learning purposes.

### What I can find here?
Right now? Nothing :( but my plan is to demonstrate:

* Usage of RxJava in regular Android development workflow
* Usage of Android specific Rx libraries, such as RxAndroid, RxLifecycle, RxBindings and others
* Testing techniques when using RxJava
* Party tricks to impress your friends! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ (kidding)


### List of exercises
I'll update this section as soon as I have new stuff coming!

### Links that I'm using to learn

* [The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) - A gist by AndrÃ© Staltz with a very good introduction about Reactive Programming for who's starting to learn (like me)
* [RxMarbles](http://www.rxmarbles.com) - Interactive website to see how Rx operators works with real stream examples
* [RxJava for Android App Development (Free Ebook)](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/rxjava-for-android-app-development.csp) - A free book by K. Matt Dupree with a quick introduction about how to use RxJava for Android development

### How can I help?
If you found something wrong or want to help in someway, make an PR or create an issue, it will help me to learn more about it!
